# Ensemble-ML-for-cancer-prediction

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model for assessing the likelihood of colorectal cancer based on specific gene expressions. We aim to enhance the existing colorectal cancer prediction model by implementing a custom bagging algorithm, an ensemble machine learning technique, and leveraging a gene expression dataset. The goal is to train models that provide more precise and improved predictions of cancer occurrence.

## User-Friendly Interface
In addition to the predictive model development, we aim to create a user-friendly interface that simplifies the exploration of the final product. The website's interface will enable users to easily upload the required CSV files, specify the target column name, and select the desired number of columns for feature selection.

## Significance
This project's significance lies in the implementation of an ensemble machine learning prediction model, which can assist biomedical professionals in automating the identification of molecular markers for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The developed model has the potential to streamline the process of identifying important molecular markers, thereby aiding in the early detection and diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

## Recommended hardware
In order to maximize performance throughout our workflow, it is recommended to have hardware configurations comparable to the specifications outlined in Table 1 for Window and Table 2 for MacOS. These recommendations are based on our extensive utilization of this specific hardware setup for a range of tasks, including data preprocessing, model training, testing, and running our graphical user interface (GUI).
